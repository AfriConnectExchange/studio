**1. Escrow Payment (Recommended)**
This is the most secure way to pay. Your money is held by AfriConnect and only released to the seller after you confirm that you've received your item as described. This protects you from fraud.

**2. Card Payment (Stripe)**
Pay directly using your debit or credit card. We partner with Stripe, a global leader in online payments, to ensure your card details are processed securely.

**3. Digital Wallets (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay)**
Use your favorite digital wallet for a fast and convenient checkout experience.

**4. Flutterwave**
A great option for users in Africa, allowing payments via mobile money, bank transfer, and other local methods.

**5. Cash on Delivery**
For certain locations and sellers, you can choose to pay in cash when your order is delivered. This option is typically only available for lower-value items.

**6. Barter Exchange**
If a seller has enabled this option, you can propose to trade an item or service of yours instead of paying with money.`,

    title: 'How to identify trustworthy sellers',
    content: `Your safety is our priority. Hereâ€™s how to identify trustworthy sellers on AfriConnect.

**Look for Verification Badges**
On a seller's profile or product page, look for these badges:
- **KYC Verified**: The seller has completed our full identity and business verification process. This is the highest level of trust.
- **Verified Seller**: A general badge indicating the seller has met our basic trust criteria.

**Check Seller Ratings and Reviews**
- Look for a high star rating (4 stars or above is great).
- Read recent reviews from other buyers. Pay attention to comments about product quality, shipping speed, and communication.

**Review the Seller's Profile**
- How long have they been a member?
- Do they have a profile picture and a clear description of their business?
- How many sales have they made?

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- No verification badges.
- Prices that seem too good to be true.
- Vague product descriptions or poor-quality photos.
- Requests to communicate or pay outside of the AfriConnect platform. **Never pay a seller directly.**

**Our Recommendation:**
For high-value items or when buying from a new seller, always use our **Escrow Payment** option for maximum security.`,
